# Copilot Instructions (DRY Principle)

- Implement reusable base classes and functions for all components.
- Use configuration files and environment variables for all settings.
- Centralize error handling, logging, and monitoring logic.
- Create generic utilities for rate limiting, circuit breaker, and backoff.
- Document reusable patterns and leverage existing abstractions for new features.
- Refactor regularly to extract common logic into shared modules.
- Avoid code duplication by following the DRY principle throughout the project.
