# Project Task List (DRY Principle, Modular & Incremental)

## 1. Minimal Working Telegram Bot
- Create a simple Telegram bot that responds to `/start` with a welcome message.

## 2. Modularize Core Structure
- Refactor bot into modules: main entry, command handlers, configuration.

## 3. Add Instagram Download Stub
- Add a placeholder function for Instagram content download (no real API yet).

## 4. Integrate Download to Telegram
- Accept Instagram URL, reply with stub "Downloaded" message.

## 5. Add Environment Configuration
- Move bot token/settings to `.env` file and load them.

## 6. Add Error Handling and Logging
- Centralize error handling and add basic logging.

## 7. Expand with Real Instagram Download
- Replace stub with real download logic (using a library or API).

## 8. Add Rate Limiting and Health Check
- Implement simple rate limiting and a `/health` command.

## 9. Retain Backward Compatibility & Goal
- Ensure each module builds on the previous, maintaining original goals and compatibility.

## 10. Full Feature Integration (from original plan)
- Implement Service Manager, Command Router, Base Service, session/database management, security, monitoring, and deployment as described in the original plan.
